############################################
#
# NOTE: This program is in BETA now
# 
# This example will show you how to use the LEGO EV3 Ultrasonic sensor with the BrickPi.  
# Note you must have the latest firmware installed on the BrickPi or this example to work.  
# Sensor is attached to Port 4.
##
# Select the mode of operation below.  These are the modes of operation for the gyro.
# TYPE_SENSOR_EV3_US_M0 - Continuous measurement, distance, cm
# TYPE_SENSOR_EV3_US_M1 - Continuous measurement, distance, in
# TYPE_SENSOR_EV3_US_M2 - Listen // 0 r 1 depending on presence of another US sensor.
