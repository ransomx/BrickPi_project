############################################
#
# NOTE: This program is in BETA now
#
# This example will show you how to use the LEGO EV3 Gyro sensor with the BrickPi.  
# Note you must have the latest firmware installed on the BrickPi or this example to work.  
# Gyro sensor is attached to Port 4.
##
# Select the mode of operation below.  These are the modes of operation for the gyro.
# TYPE_SENSOR_EV3_GYRO_M0 - Returns absolute angle turned from startup.
# TYPE_SENSOR_EV3_GYRO_M1 -  Rotational Speed
# TYPE_SENSOR_EV3_GYRO_M2 -  Raw sensor value ???
# TYPE_SENSOR_EV3_GYRO_M3 -  Angle and Rotational Speed?

# There's often a long wait for setup with the EV3 sensors.
# EV3 gyro works best (less drift and less error results) if you hold it still in setup.
