# This is an example of controlling the rotation of motors using encoders
from BrickPi import *   #import BrickPi.py file to use BrickPi operations

BrickPiSetup()  # setup the serial port for sudo su communication
BrickPiSetupSensors()       #Send the properties of sensors to BrickPi
BrickPiUpdateValues()

Pass the arguments in a list. 
If a single motor has to be controlled then the arguments should be passed like 
elements of an array,e.g, motorRotateDegree([255],[360],[PORT_A]) where power=255 and
angle=360 for the motor connected at Port A
"""
power=[255]
deg=[360]
port=[PORT_A]
motorRotateDegree(power,deg,port)		#This read the encoder values every 100 ms (default). Not that accurate but not very processor intensive
#motorRotateDegree(power,deg,port,.05)	#This read the encoder values every 50 ms. A little more accurate 
#motorRotateDegree(power,deg,port,0)	#This read the encoder values without any delay. Most accurate but take a lot of processing power
#motorRotateDegree(power,deg,port,0,.04)	#This read the encoder values without any delay. The time to rotate the motors in the opposite direction when stopping is specified in the last argument. Useful when free running the motors

"""
If multiple motors have to be controlled then the parameters for running each motor must be passed
as the elements of an array,e.g, motorRotateDegree([255,100],[360,30],[PORT_A,PORT_B]) where 
power=255 and angle=30 are for motor at PORT_A and power=100 and angle=30 are for motor at PORT_B.
It can be used similarly for any number of motors.
